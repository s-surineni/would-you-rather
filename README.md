# ðŸ§© Would You Rather â€“ React Voting App

A React-based voting app that displays a series of "Would You Rather" questions with images. Users can vote, navigate across questions, and all votes are persisted using localStorage. A timer adds urgency to each question.

## Note:
You're not required to code all the individual components, they are 
already provided and rendered as a skeleton for you. (E.g. Question component, Options Component etc.)
You are only required to finish the missing pieces in App.js file

## âœ… Milestones

| Milestone | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Start with fetching the first question, ensure "Loading next question..." is shown while fetching the question, and render the question with its 2 choices once its fetched |
| **2** | Implement voting logic and navigation: allow a single vote per question and support Prev/Next navigation. No revoting is allowed |
| **3** | Persist all user votes in `localStorage`, so refreshing the page retains answers |
| **4** | A  5-second timer component is added for you - ensure that it starts when a question is displayed. Disable voting for the current question after time runs out. |
